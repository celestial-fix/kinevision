# KineVision Implementation Plan

## Goal Description
Build a mobility recovery tracking platform connecting patients, professionals, and AI trainers.
**Key Features:**
- **Frontend**: Basic component rendering tests.

### Manual Verification
- **CV Accuracy**: Visually verify that the `PoseTracker` draws skeletons correctly over the video feed.
- **Coach Feedback**: Perform an exercise incorrectly (e.g., squat with bad form) and verify the UI displays the correct warning.
- **Data Flow**: Complete a session and check if it appears in the Professional Dashboard.
- **Trainer Flow**: Upload a video as a Trainer, then log in as another Trainer to rate it.
